#Documentation Generation
In addition to the core development, we recognize the importance of comprehensive documentation. Consequently, we've generated documentation that provides insights into the functionalities and usage of the command line interpreter, coupled with the backend and file storage system.

#The documentation covers details on:

Commands available, such as show, create, update, destroy, and count.
Actions that can be performed, including creating new objects (e.g., User or Place), retrieving objects from files or databases, performing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.), updating object attributes, and destroying objects.
This documentation serves as a valuable resource for users and developers alike, offering clarity on how to interact with the application and leverage its capabilities effectively.
