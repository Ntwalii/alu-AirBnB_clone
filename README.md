#Documentation Generation
Documentation Generation
Understanding the critical role of comprehensive documentation, we took proactive measures to ensure that our project is not only well-developed but also well-documented. The generated documentation provides an in-depth understanding of the functionalities and use cases of the command line interpreter, intricately integrated with the backend and file storage system.

This documentation is a comprehensive guide, covering details on:

Commands available: Including show, create, update, destroy, and count.
Actions that can be performed: Ranging from creating new objects (e.g., User or Place) to retrieving objects from various sources like files or databases.
Performing operations on objects: Examples include counting, computing statistics, and more.
Updating object attributes: A crucial aspect allowing flexibility and customization.
Destroying objects: Providing the necessary functionality to manage and remove objects as needed.
Our documentation serves as a valuable resource for users and developers alike. It not only elucidates the technical intricacies of the application but also aims to empower users to interact seamlessly with the system, unlocking its full potential.

As we progress in this journey, we remain committed to maintaining transparent and accessible documentation, ensuring a positive and enriching experience for all stakeholders involved in the AirBnB clone project.
